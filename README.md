# Introduction
Data is everywhere and part and parcel of every business or processes functioning a business or in simpler an eternal resource, but very little people realized its importance before this era of the surge towards data-intensive applications.  The biggest reason attributed so far for the delay of coming of this data age where data seems to be the new oil has been the lack of computation power.

The most frequent and powerful machine learning algorithms were developed way before in late 1990 but the computation power was never there to fully augment these algorithms to be used where their power could be felt. A major roadblock in the usage of these resources had been the non-availability of efficient open source languages capable of dealing with different algorithms and enabling a single user to delve into the world of data and really harness the usage of data in building amazing applications.In terms of languages that are enabling people to make a dent in this data-driven world then, certainly python has taken the cake considering its usefulness both as a general purpose language and specifically for dealing with different facets of data science be it computer vision, Natural language processing, Predictive modelling , and of-course visualization.

Python is not only used to apply powerful ML algorithms but also has inherent features to tell amazing stories of data powered through its visualizations and this enables data to show insights through stories and create visualizations that enable the decision makers to understand data well and to implement changes effectively.

In order to explore the various facets of python, visualization let us tell a story in our way using different libraries of python around a famous and popular dataset known as iris.

# Why is Visualization important?
A lot of information received is generally stored in form of tables and text and we can access the exact amount or numbers that respond or correspond to the information but then why do we need to visualize it.

The answer to this question lies in the inner workings of the human mind and it is a well-known fact that our brain recognizes images faster. At birth, a baby understands the image of his or her mother months before being able to understand what the word mommy means. We understand images instantly and we have to work to process text.

In fact, the brain processes image 60,000 times faster than it does text. And it’s more accustomed to processing images—ninety percent of the information sent to the brain is visual, and 93 % of all human communication is visual and none of this is new or recent. The human brain has always processed images ridiculously faster than words.

Then it certainly means a lot to visualize data and build stories around about it to explain them intuitively and thus enables us to derive insight out of visual information and that is why we need visualization as important part of the process while dealing with data providing insights that can help us take effective business decisions.


# Visualization libraries in python
We will look at the main libraries in python that are used to create exciting plots and enable us to draw inferences out of them. Some of the main libraries in python are as under

* Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the backbone of Python data visualization libraries. Despite being over a decade old, it’s still the most widely used library for plotting in the Python community.  It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB, a proprietary programming language developed in the 1980s.

Matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library and so many other libraries are built on top of it or designed to work in tandem with it during analysis. Some libraries like pandas and Seaborn are wrappers over matplotlib. They allow you to access a number of matplotlib’s methods with less code.

# Seaborn
It harnesses the power of matplotlib to create beautiful charts by using only a few lines of code. The key difference is Seaborn’s default styles and color palettes, which are designed to be more aesthetically pleasing and modern.  Since Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, you will need to know matplotlib to tweak Seaborn’s defaults.

# Pandas:
* powerful Python data analysis toolkit
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

# Plots in Python
In order to fully understand the power of visualization, there can be no other way but to visualize the data in exciting and let data speak out itself. We are going to use the dataset iris to fully explore the resourcefulness of python and make data talk.


# Scatterplot
A scatterplot is mostly used to create a plot between two continuous variables and it reflects points scattered all over.
Scatterplot shown above depicts the highest value of SepalwidthCm is for a value of SepalLengthCm close to 5.70  and the highest  SepalLengthCm values correspond to   SepalwidthCm values close
